# Learning machine learning

I use this project to actually implement all sorts of machine learning algorithms, to understand
better the details behind them. Along the way I make notes to help me with this goal, and you are
welcome to read them as well:

1. Studying Neural Networks: Starting with the simplest one - [MNIST](mnist/mnist.md)
2. Introduction to computer vision: [corner and edge detection](vision/sift.ipynb)
3. Dimension reduction using [principal component analysis](fashion_mnist/pca.md)
4. Multiple view geometry: [the math behind stitching together 2D images](vision/points_of_view.md)
5. Sift comparisons: While I didn't write anything about it, I do have several examples of image
   comparisons using my implementation [here](vision/images/sift_comparisons/sift_compare.md).

Found it interesting and have some feedback? Want me to add another explanation to the list? If so, let me know.
